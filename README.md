This project was done as part of The Odin Project's Full-Stack Javascript Path.

I found it moderately difficult, both to try keeping everything out of global scope (as was asked in the instructions), and to keep everything making sense together.

I tried building my AI without researching it first, and my solution started to look a bit too much hard coded, so I researched it a bit and tried to implement my findings, but it didn't really go well with how I had started to implement other parts of the project, so I though of another way and it ended up working well, but I'm aware that my solution is not pretty and I'd like to come back to it when I feel more equipped for cleaning up code.

All in all, it was an interesting learning experience, as I had never built any type of AI.
